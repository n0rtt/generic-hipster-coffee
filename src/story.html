        <h1>Our story</h1>
        <p>
            GHC started as a project of two friends and passionate baristas, John & Don in 2010.
        </p>
        <p>
            Believing as much in the hand of an educated barista as in the innovative equipment of the our ever-growing industry, GHC offers a full spectrum of brewing opportunities â€“ from pour overs to syphon pots to finely executed espresso beverages. Each cup of coffee is made with love, precision and care.
